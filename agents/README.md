This directory defines the full agent staff of the MISJustice Alliance Firm platform. Each agent is a bounded role with a defined scope, search permission tier, tool set, and list of systems it may access. Agents operate under the OpenClaw / NemoClaw orchestration layer and are subject to the human-in-the-loop governance model defined in [`README.md §4`](../README.md#4-human-in-the-loop-governance).

## Orchestration Layer

All agents are dispatched, monitored, and governed through the **OpenClaw / NemoClaw** orchestration stack:

| Component | Function |
|---|---|
| **OpenClaw** | Central task router and multi-agent dispatcher; manages delegation chains, queuing, tool invocation, and session context |
| **NemoClaw** | Sandbox and protection layer; enforces scope boundaries, blocks prohibited tool calls, and logs all agent actions |
| **AgenticMail** | Approval queue and outbound messaging infrastructure; all external communications route through AgenticMail for human review before dispatch |

Agents never communicate directly with external parties, public APIs, or other agents outside of explicitly defined tool channels. All inter-agent coordination is brokered through OpenClaw.

---

## Search Permission Tiers

All agent search traffic is routed through the private SearXNG instance via the LiteLLM proxy. Each agent is assigned a search tier that defines which engine groups and index scopes it may access. Agents never touch SearXNG directly or query commercial search engines.

| Tier | Token | Agents | Engine groups accessible |
|---|---|---|---|
| T0 | `publicsafe` | Sol, Quill, Mira, Webmaster, Social Media Manager | Public legal databases, curated public web, public-safe internal summaries |
| T1 | `internal` | Avery, Rae, Ollie | T0 + internal-safe MCAS / OpenRAG search |
| T2 | `restricted` | Lex, Casey | T1 + restricted internal indexes, selected attorney/court registries |
| T3 | `pi` | Iris | T2 + OSINT / public-record specialty engines |
| T4 | `admin` | Human operators only (incl. via Vane) | All engines, diagnostic and admin views |

## Agent File Structure Convention

Each agent subdirectory follows this standard layout:

```
agents/{agent-name}/
├── SOUL.md           # Agent identity constitution: persistent personality, values, boundaries,
│                    #   tone, and behavioral commitments that persist across all sessions.
├── agent.yaml        # Role configuration: tool bindings, search tier token, MCAS API scope,
│                    #   LLM model selection, temperature, memory config, and OpenClaw wiring.
└── system_prompt.md  # Operational system prompt: task framing, allowed/prohibited actions,
                     #   output format expectations, and handoff protocols.
```

**`SOUL.md`** defines the agent’s persistent identity — who it is, what it values, and what it will not do — independently of any specific task or session. It is the ethical and behavioral foundation that all other configuration inherits from.

**`agent.yaml`** is the operational configuration that wires the agent to the platform: which tools it can call, which search tier token it uses, which MCAS API scopes are granted, and how it is registered in OpenClaw.

**`system_prompt.md`** is the task-level instruction set: what the agent does in a given session, what it produces, and how it hands off to the next stage.

## HITL Gate Summary

The following table summarizes the human-in-the-loop approval gates that apply to each agent. Gates are enforced by OpenClaw / NemoClaw and cannot be bypassed. See [`README.md §4`](../README.md#4-human-in-the-loop-governance) and [`docs/legal/ethics_policy.md §5`](../docs/legal/ethics_policy.md#5-ai-agent-ethics-and-autonomy-limits) for full policy.

| Agent | Gate | Required human action |
|---|---|---|
| **Avery** | New matter intake | Approve/defer/reject; confirm Tier for uploaded evidence |
| **Avery** | Evidence Tier classification | Human confirms Tier before MCAS record is finalized |
| **Rae** | Research scope | Human defines scope before AutoResearchClaw is invoked |
| **Lex** | Pattern-of-practice finding | Human reviews and approves language before inclusion in any output |
| **Iris** | PI-tier query | Human authorizes scope before PI-tier search is issued; queries logged and audited |
| **Casey** | Referral packet transmission | Human reviews, edits, and explicitly authorizes before send |
| **Ollie** | Any external communication | Human reviews and approves all outreach drafts via AgenticMail |
| **Webmaster** | Web publication | Human approves final text, redaction, and indexing decision |
| **Webmaster** | GitBook publication | Same as above |
| **Social Media Manager** | Posts alleging misconduct against identifiable actors | Human reviews and approves before post |
| **Social Media Manager** | Campaign sequences | Human approves full campaign sequence |
| **Sol** | QA report | Sol’s QA report is a required input to every publication approval; human resolves flagged items |
| **Quill** | New GitBook pages or structural changes | Human approval required |
